            Once before, Seven mythical Gods appeared on Earth.Their battle split the earth and tore the sky. 10 years after the battle, the calamity should have been long gone already.
<br/><br/>
However. A boy named Shinsen Raika had his true little sister abducted by a god in the battle and was currently standing in the『Academy』on an artificial island in the distant seas.
<br/><br/>
Here, the night was called as after school time. During that time period, the 『Gods’ Proxy War』 were being held by using Divinity-Compatible people for gaining the seat of the law of world (The supreme God).
<br/><br/>
On the first night, Raika was attacked by a Norse mythological God called Brynhildr. Facing death in front of himself he acquired the detestable power of gods, the power for revenge.
<br/><br/>
「Become my s*ave! Give me not just your hands and legs, but also your fingers, toes, and even your soul!」.
<br/><br/>
Absolute Domination, using that power from the devil eye of Balor, he tries to take back the world from Gods control. A new mythical heroic saga of a devil eye-user person swearing to take revenge on Gods begins now!
