            “Are you coming?” The time was 11:00 p.m.
<br/><br/>
Kuraki Yamato, an ordinary high school student, was on his way home from the convenience store when he met Shirase Sayla, a beautiful girl from his class who was known as a saint.
<br/><br/>
She invited him to spend some time with her in the downtown area in the middle of the night, and that day was the start of the new relationship between the two.
<br/><br/>
They played darts for the first time, lend and borrowed CDs, and visited ramen shops…
<br/><br/>
Yamato’s boring daily life became more colourful as he got involved with Sayla, who sometimes spoiled him and had a mischievous side.
<br/><br/>
“I’m really glad that Yamato came along with me at that time.”
<br/><br/>
This was the beginning of a sweet, precious story of youth and love spent with a saintly woman who was a natural in every way.
