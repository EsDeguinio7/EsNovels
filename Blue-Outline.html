            Eye-catching. Stunning. Addictive. Mesmerizing.
<br/><br/>
Those were the impressions left upon those who had seen her paintings.
<br/><br/>
It was what I aspire to be, as a high school student who wishes to pursue art.
<br/><br/>
No matter what she created, they were all named as the works of “Genius”. An artist with unparalleled talent, Kashiwazaki Yuri.
<br/><br/>
 “I came here just to see you. I only paint what I desire.” 
<br/><br/>
The one closest to me, yet also the furthest away; my childhood friend.
<br/><br/>
One day she suddenly stopped painting. But I continued to stroke my paintbrush as I chased after her shadows. 
<br/><br/>
“I’ll paint again and again. I won’t give up. Talent doesn’t matter.”
<br/><br/>
I’m going to make her enjoy painting again. And I’d show her that my creations are superior.
<br/><br/>
This is a story of an ordinary person who devoted his youth to painting, challenging the “Genius”—.
<br/><br/>
