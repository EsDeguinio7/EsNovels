            Onii-san is the man who can make me grow up! Marry me!
<br/><br/>
The room of a university student with zero love experience, Tsukasa, has become the hangout spot for his younger sister, who made her debut as a yankee when she entered high school, and her friends.
<br/><br/>
One day, he found a bulge on his bed and flipped over the cover to find Erika, the most beautiful girl among his younger sister’s friends, asleep.
<br/><br/>
“Ah, sorry… My period just makes me so sleepy”
<br/><br/>
“You’re too frank, I don’t know how to respond to that…”
<br/><br/>
Unable to leave such a naive and free-spirited girl alone, Tsukasa started to drill her in manners and common sense.
<br/><br/>
Falling in love with Tsukasa, without hiding her feelings of “love”, Erika makes a ferocious approach on him! On the other hand, Tsukasa was also charmed by her upfrontness as she tried her best to learn what was taught to her.
<br/><br/>
The love life of a yankee high schooler and a caring university student begins!
