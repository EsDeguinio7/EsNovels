            Kohei Kurose and Yuzuhana Koikawa were hit by a car right after they filed for divorce and they both went back in time on the day of the high school entrance ceremony.
<br/><br/>
Knowing that they had both returned to the past, they said, â€œI will never get involved with you again in order to live a happy life! I swear!
<br/><br/>
But, they both share the same hobbies and are very compatible with each other.
<br/><br/>
As a result, everytime I go, I end up having to spend time with her. I was reluctant at first, but as time went on I realized that spending time together is much more fun than spending time alone
<br/><br/>
This is a story about an ex husband and wife who return to their youth and are attracted to each other again.
