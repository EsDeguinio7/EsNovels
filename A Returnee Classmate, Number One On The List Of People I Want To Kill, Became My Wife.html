            “I like you. Kageo!”
<br/><br/>
At his home’s entrance, the girl ranked number one on the list of people he wanted to kill pushed him down and was sucking his penis
<br/><br/>
Just, what the hell is this situation!?
<br/><br/>
Although he saved her from falling down the stairs, a sudden expression of love with a fellatio is frightening. Kageo wanted to run away immediately.
<br/><br/>
“No problem-desu. I will suck more-desu”
<br/><br/>
“No, Sudou-san, things are already getting bad, though”
<br/><br/>
Is Sudou-san, a slut?
<br/><br/>
No way. Even though she looks so innocent
<br/><br/>
“Kageo, annoying!! I like you, true!! Believe-desu!”
<br/><br/>
Lalya made a sulky face. Because she was really beautiful, there was a punch when she got angry and it was overwhelming.
<br/><br/>
“I’m sorry!”
<br/><br/>
He apologized and ejaculated at the same time.
