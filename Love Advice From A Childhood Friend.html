            “I’ve found someone I like.”
<br/><br/>
In his second year of high school, the main character, Ryunosuke, was asked for advice by his childhood friend, Hinagata Shiori, who sat next to him in class.
<br/><br/>
Why does Takamine’s beautiful childhood friend look down on herself?
<br/><br/>
Despite his doubts, the protagonist, who has never been in love before, tries to answer his childhood friend’s earnest question.
<br/><br/>
Wouldn’t she prefer asking someone more dependable? But his childhood friend shakes her head, saying that she prefers Ryunosuke.
<br/><br/>
When he asked her about it, she said that the person she likes has similar characteristics to him.
<br/><br/>
(Isn’t that me?). But he was too embarrassed to ask her, fearing that he might be wrong.
<br/><br/>
“He’s good-looking, from my point of view.”
<br/><br/>
(Oh, no.)
<br/><br/>
“He doesn’t have many friends. He’s also a bit of a nerd.”
<br/><br/>
(You mean me?)
<br/><br/>
“But he’s refreshing.”
<br/><br/>
(That’s not me.)
<br/><br/>
“He’s a guy I’ve known for a long time who lives in my neighborhood.”
<br/><br/>
(That’s me, right?)
<br/><br/>
Without knowing for sure, Ryunosuke gives Shiori some advice even though he doesn’t know what to do with her.
<br/><br/>
But what he doesn’t realize is that his advice is being put into practice.
<br/><br/>
As he counsels her, he becomes aware of her as a girl, and before he knows it, he begins to like her without even realizing it.
