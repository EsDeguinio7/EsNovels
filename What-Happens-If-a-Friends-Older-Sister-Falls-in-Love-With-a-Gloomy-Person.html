            A self-proclaimed unattractive gloomy high schooler, Hiramiya Reiji, everytime he goes to visit his close friend’s house, he gets messed around by his older sister, Sakuya.
<br/><br/>
Drinking his drink as she pleases, barging into the bathroom, and crawling under his blanket in the middle of the night…
<br/><br/>
Thinking that perhaps he has done something to make her dislike him, he asked his close friend whether he has any idea, but he only gets a reply in a incomprehensible way, “you still haven’t noticed it, huh”
<br/><br/>
On a certain day, Reiji loses in a game and has to listen to 3 of Sakuya’s wishes.
<br/><br/>
Reiji goes along with it even though he has doubts, but could he gradually begin to understand Sakuya’s true feelings…?
<br/><br/>
This is the story of super dense youth and a can’t-be-honest older sister until they become a lovey-dovey married couple――
