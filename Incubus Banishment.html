            A world where one’s life was decided by one’s talent called Gift.
The main character Erio Scarlet who was born in the house of influential noble family that had produced a lot of Holy Knights manifested a suspicious gift Incubus in the conferment ceremony. Furthermore the skill attached to that Gift was only one embarrassing skill called Peerless.
<br/><br/>
Erio was banished from the city because there was no way his indecent existence could be permitted in a family of Holy Knights but……somehow he went through an amazing growth when he dealt with his horniness though!?
<br/><br/>
In addition when his childhood friend who was bestowed with the Gift Sacred Knight chased after the main character because of her love for him reverse ra-……did it with him, a lot of powerful indecent skills showed up and on top of that they even got bound by Master-Servant contract……!?
<br/><br/>
This was the indecent heroic tale of the boy who was gifted with indecent Gift rising in the world while [getting along] with a lot of girls.
